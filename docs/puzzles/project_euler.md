# Project Euler
Project Euler is a collection of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve. A large part of the appeal of Project Euler is that the problems can often be solved with clever algorithms and efficient coding techniques.

These are the problems I have solved from Project Euler.
